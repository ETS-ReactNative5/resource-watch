        <h2>Past Warming and Bleaching</h2>
        <p>
          Mass coral bleaching has occurred around the globe, increasing in frequency and severity as sea temperatures have risen over time.&nbsp;Extreme bleaching events often kill corals outright, while less extreme events can weaken corals, reducing growth and reproduction, and leaving them vulnerable to disease. The time between heat stress events is critical for coral recovery. In addition, areas with low levels of local threats tend to be more resilient.
          {' '}
          <strong>Between 1985 and 2018, 87.4% of the worldâ€™s reefs experienced bleaching level heat stress, while 42.5% underwent severe heat stress.</strong>
